# For a simple bunch of thumbnails that open a youtube video in an overlay:
# Add your video ids here in the front matter, like:
# 
# videos:
# - id: 6AJx8IVcL_c
#   title: "Optional Title"
# - id: rldnu9rNpH8
#   title: "Optional Title"
# ...
# 
# The ids can be found in a youtube video's URL. For example, the URL:
#   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AJx8IVcL_c
# has the id 6AJx8IVcL_c .
#
# You can also put content below the frontmatter as Markdown, including text or 
# section headers or whatever. 
# To embed a video:    
#   {% include youtubeSingle.html id="6AJx8IVcL_c" %}
# To embed a playlist: 
#   {% include youtubePlaylist.html id="LbxXG_dErfEuoWBovbeSmSCJs3vE1fwI-" %}
# To embed a thumbnail for a pop-up video:
